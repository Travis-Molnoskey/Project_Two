Bubbles for Brews

Repository for Team 1 contributions to Project 2

With this project we aim to visualize data about brewery and beer production across the United States. 
Production volume per state, over time and largest number of unique types produced will be visualized with bubble charts.
Breweries with highest average reviews will be visualized in a leaflet map with pop-ups that contain the name and basic info on the brewery.
